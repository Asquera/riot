*0.10.13.pre*

*0.10.12*

* Recognizing file and line number of an assertion declaration on failure [vandrijevik]

* RR support in Riot [vandrijevik,jaknowlden]

    # teststrap.rb
    require 'riot'
    require 'riot/rr'
    
    # your-test.rb
    context "foo" do
      asserts("failure due to not calling hello") { mock!.hello {"world"} } # actually fails
    end

* Added Riot::Message to make messages in macros easier to write [jaknowlden]

    def evaluate(actual, expected)
      # ...
      expected == actual pass(new_message.received(expected)) ? fail(expected(expected).not(actual))
      # ...
    end

* Added responds_to as a respond_to alias [jaknowlden]

* Added the equivalent_to macro to compare case equality (===). equals is now (==) [jaknowlden]

* Assuming RootContext if nil parent provided. Added Context#parent to the API [jaknowlden]

    Riot::Context.new("Hi", nil) {}.parent.class
    => Riot::RootContext

*0.10.11*

* Context#asserts_topic now takes an optional description [gabrielg, jaknowlden]

    asserts_topic.exists
    asserts_topic("some kind of description").exists

* Added not! assertion macro [gabrielg, jaknowlden]

    setup { User.new(:funny? => false) }
    asserts(:funny?).not!

* Added Context#hookup to add some setup code to an already defined topic [jaknowlden]

    context "yo mama" do
      setup { YoMama.new }
      # ...
      context "is cool" do
        hookup { topic.do_something_involving_state }
        asserts_topic.kind_of?(YoMama)
      end
    end

* Added Riot.alone! mode to ensure Riot.run is not run at-exit [jaknowlden]

    Riot.alone!
    Riot.run

  This will still print output unless you also Riot.silently!

* Returning non-zero status at-exit when tests don't pass [gabrielg, jaknowlden]

*0.10.10*

* Passing assertion macros can now return a custom message [dasch, jaknowlden]

    def evaluate(actual, *expectings)
      1 == 1 ? pass("1 does equal 1") : fail("1 does not equal 1 in this universe")
    end

* Removing Context#extend_assertions and related code [jaknowlden]

* Allow the use of symbolic descriptions as shorthands for sending the message to the topic [dasch]

    setup { "foo" }
    asserts(:upcase).equals("FOO")

* Added AssertionMacro and #register for macros [jaknowlden, splattael]

    module My
      class CustomThingAssertion < Riot::AssertionMacro
        register :custom_thing
        expects_exception!

        def evaluate(actual, *expectings)
          # ...
        end
      end
      
      Riot::Assertion.register_macro :custom_thing, CustomThingAssertion
    end

* Replace IOReporter#say with #puts. Also add #print. [splattael]

    class SomeNewReporter < IOReporter
      def pass
        puts "I PASSED"
      end

      def fail
        print "F"
      end
      # ...
    end

*0.10.9 and before*
